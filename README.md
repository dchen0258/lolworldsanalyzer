# League of Legends Worlds Analysis

Currently, Riot Games is hosting its League of Legends World Championship. I want to use the Riot API to get information about teams and playersâ€™ champion pools and solo queue (playing the game by themselves outside of the game) answer some statistics about the current champions and win rates in these games compared to the games they are playing on stage (at the tournament) and creating a model to predict the win rate for a team vs another team based on these performances, along with their champion picks. I also hope to gather so broader statistics about the best champion pairings per team (ones with the highest win rates)

Week 4: Get API connection set up and basic player and team information set up. \n
Week 5: Get basic statistics, given a player or team (win rates per champion, overall win rate) \n
Week 6: Play around with models to see the what model is best to predict game performance based on past performance and champion picks \n
Week 7: Finalize model and start assessing predictions \n
Week 8: Calculate more advanced statistics, like best champion pairings for teams. \n
Week 9: Clean up codebase and write documentation explaning how to run models. \n
